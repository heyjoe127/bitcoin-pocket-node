# Bitcoin Pocket Node — Development Plan

## Phase 0: Research & Toolchain ✅

- [x] Cross-compile `bitcoind` for ARM64 Android (13MB stripped, NDK r27)
- [x] Set up Android SDK + NDK r27 on dev machine (Big Sur, i7-4870HQ)
- [x] Test bitcoind on real Pixel 7 Pro — RPC responds, peers connect
- [x] Generate UTXO snapshot from Umbrel (Knots 29.2.0, `dumptxoutset rollback`)
- [x] Patch chainparams with AssumeUTXO heights 880k, 910k (backported from Core 30)

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept ✅

- [x] Android app (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) bundles bitcoind as `libbitcoind.so`
- [x] Foreground service starts/stops bitcoind
- [x] `loadtxoutset` via local RPC — 167M UTXOs loaded on Pixel 7 Pro
- [x] Node connects to P2P network and syncs forward from snapshot
- [x] Dashboard: block height, sync progress with ETA, peers, animated status dot

## Phase 2: Snapshot Manager ✅

- [x] SFTP download from personal node over LAN (~5 min for 9 GB)
- [x] Snapshot generation via SSH (`dumptxoutset rollback` on remote node)
- [x] Snapshot block hash validation before loading (auto-redownload if wrong)
- [x] Non-blocking loadtxoutset with progress polling (tails debug.log)
- [x] Early completion detection (skip re-download if already loaded)
- [x] "Try pocketnode first" — check for existing snapshot with saved SFTP creds
- [ ] Download from HTTPS URL (utxo.download)
- [ ] Load from local file (USB/SD/Downloads)

## Phase 3: Smart Syncing ✅

- [x] Network-aware sync — auto-pauses on cellular, resumes on WiFi
- [x] VPN support — WireGuard/VPN treated as connected
- [x] Foreground service with persistent notification
- [x] Data usage tracking with WiFi/cellular budgets
- [x] Auto-start on app launch (SharedPreferences flag)
- [ ] Charging-aware sync (configurable)
- [ ] Doze mode handling
- [ ] Detect when behind prune window → offer re-bootstrap

## Phase 4: Node Setup & Security ✅

- [x] SSH setup wizard — creates restricted `pocketnode` SFTP account
- [x] Platform-agnostic detection (Docker vs native, not hardcoding Umbrel/Start9)
- [x] Root-owned copy scripts — pocketnode never has data dir access
- [x] Admin credentials never saved (username pre-filled from SharedPreferences)
- [x] View/remove node access from app
- [x] Setup checklist (Config mode) with auto-detection of completed steps
- [x] `network_security_config.xml` — cleartext HTTP to localhost only
- [x] GrapheneOS W^X compliance — bitcoind in `jniLibs/` → `nativeLibraryDir`

## Phase 5: Wallet RPC Interface

- [ ] Localhost RPC endpoint for external wallet apps
- [ ] Connection instructions / QR code for supported wallets
- [ ] Electrum server integration (optional, stretch goal)

## Phase 6: Polish & Release

- [ ] Onboarding flow
- [ ] Storage management (prune depth configuration)
- [ ] Peer management UI
- [ ] Mempool viewer
- [ ] Config mode / Run mode UX refinement
- [ ] Beta testing on multiple Pixel devices
- [ ] F-Droid / APK distribution (no Google Play)
- [ ] Auto-restart detection in foreground service
- [ ] Clean up old snapshot files on Umbrel

## Technical Risks (Resolved)

1. ~~**bitcoind ARM64 compilation**~~ ✅ Works with NDK r27 clang wrappers
2. ~~**Android background process limits**~~ ✅ Foreground service handles it
3. ~~**Storage**~~ ✅ 9 GB snapshot + 2 GB pruned chain — clear UX about requirements
4. ~~**RAM**~~ ✅ `dbcache=256` fine on Pixel 7 Pro (12 GB RAM)
5. ~~**Thermal throttling**~~ ✅ Phone stays cool during loadtxoutset and sync
6. ~~**GrapheneOS W^X**~~ ✅ `nativeLibraryDir` is the only executable path
7. ~~**Cleartext HTTP on Android**~~ ✅ `network_security_config.xml` for localhost RPC

## Infrastructure

- **Dev machine:** 2014 MacBook Pro 15" (i7-4870HQ, 16GB, Big Sur)
- **Test node:** Umbrel VM on Mac Mini (Bitcoin Knots 29.2.0, full unpruned, 820GB chain) at 10.0.1.127:9332
- **Target hardware:** Google Pixel 7 Pro with GrapheneOS
- **Repo:** github.com/FreeOnlineUser/bitcoin-pocket-node

## bitcoind Configuration (Mobile)

```ini
server=1
prune=2048
listen=0
maxconnections=4
maxmempool=50
blockreconstructionextratxn=10
dbcache=256
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcuser=pocketnode
rpcpassword=<generated>
disablewallet=1
```

**Why no `blocksonly=1`?** Partial mempool (50MB cap) for fee estimation, payment detection, privacy cover traffic, and compact block reconstruction.

**Why v28.1 instead of Core 30.x?** Core 30 changed OP_RETURN policy. v28.1 with patched AssumeUTXO heights gives us snapshot flexibility while preserving standard transaction relay behavior.

## Nice to Haves / Backlog

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize stub file creation — only create stubs for files actually in index range (reduce 15 min pruning)
- [ ] Copy more block files (~3-4 blk/rev pairs) to cover full pruning window (reorg safety)

### BWT / Wallet
- [ ] Descriptor wallet support — replace `importmulti` with `importdescriptors`
- [ ] Taproot/P2TR output recognition
- [ ] Multisig support (comes with descriptor wallets)
- [ ] Remove `deprecatedrpc=create_bdb` dependency

### Networking
- [ ] Tor integration for private peer connections
- [ ] Phone-to-phone chainstate copy (WiFi Direct / hotspot)

### UX
- [ ] Non-technical setup documentation for everyday users
- [ ] Expanded device testing beyond Pixel line

### Maintenance
- [ ] Bitcoin Core version upgrades (v29+)
- [ ] BWT fork maintenance and modernization

### Visuals
- [ ] Block visualization — animated graphic showing stub creation → pruning → backfill (explainer for chainstate copy technique)
